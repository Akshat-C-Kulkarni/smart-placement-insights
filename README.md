# Smart Placement Insights and Prediction System

## 🎯 Aim
To analyze student academic and behavioral data to identify key factors influencing placement success and predict a student’s placement likelihood using machine learning.

## 🧠 Description
This project focuses on building a data-driven model that can predict whether a student is likely to get placed based on attributes such as CGPA, technical skills, internships, and academic performance. It involves detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification model building. The final insights and predictions will be displayed in an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**.
